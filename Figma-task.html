      Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels.
       But you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch movies.
        And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy watching a movie.
      <br>
      <br>
      In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers. 
      We will get acquainted with the stages of film production and learn how to watch a 
      movie through the eyes of a screenwriter, director and editor. We will understand 
      genres and look at the most important films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
